# Person Class

# Instructions

Create a class `Person` with properties name and age. Add a method getAgeInDays() that returns the age of the person in days (assuming 365 days per year). Create a subclass Student that extends Person, and has an additional property studentId. In the Student class, override the getAgeInDays() method to also log the studentId property to the console.

## Test case/sample input:

````const myStudent = new Student("Alice", 20, "12345");
console.log(myStudent.getAgeInDays()); // logs "Student ID: 12345" and returns 7300 (20 years * 365 days per year)```
````
